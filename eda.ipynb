This peaceful welcome is enriched by an outdoor fireplace flanked by hanging chairs with thick cushions ready to serve as a respite from the world at the end of the day....or a great place for morning coffee before taking that day on.\\r\\n            This elegant example of contemporary perfection starts hitting all the right notes from the warm embrace at the entry through the commercial glass pivoting front door to the picturesque privacy of the pool and grounds bordering a verdant greenspace beyond. The current owner, working with a professional designer, took what was already an incredible custom home and added subtle tones and touches to give each room an artful touch of glamor. Wide plank wood floors give way to tall, cut stone walls and add strong, earthy elements to the clean lines of the home's graceful, modern architecture.\\r\\n            There is nothing left to wish for in a kitchen that is a chef's Disneyland. A workhorse space that resembles a page torn from Architectural Digest is anchored with a 6-1/2 by 9-1/2 foot island, a marble-clad piece of art that beckons to be used as serious prep space for a feast or a great place to gather for take-out. Large windows above the sink look out over treetops and into the hill country landscape. Sculpted white backsplash tiles surround a Wolf 6- burner cooktop with built-in grill and a massive stainless hood. A Sub Zero refrigerator paneled to hide within the line of sleek cabinetry, double wine refrigerators, a prep sink in the island and every bell and whistle needed to inspire professional chefs or family cooks exist in a space so beautiful it belies the utility of it. A giant pantry provides space for any attendant need for storage.\\r\\n            The dining room, with walls of rich, silvery taupe, is surrounded with windows and opens to the front courtyard. Here, as in other rooms, the owner added a gorgeous, floating dropped ceiling detail of light-toned wood that gives an organic touch of natural substance within the contemporary design.\\r\\n            High, beamed ceilings in the living area hover over a modern linear gas fireplace between cut stone walls. A line of collapsing sliding doors beneath tall transom windows creates a wall of glass between the inside luxury living and the dreamy expansive covered outdoor patio and kitchen beside the pool. Opening that wall combines both spaces on a beautiful Austin day. A built-in Lynx grill can service large gatherings of friends and family around sizeable tables and seating areas in front of the outdoor fireplace and TV.\\r\\n            Built-in shelving lines the study that looks out through floor to ceiling windows to the beauty of a forever view into the hill country, lending a great environment for pensive writing or annoying payment of bills...it's a serene, inspiring retreat no matter the task.\\r\\n            Every bedroom is lovely and every bath is distinctive, with designer finishes making each space special to inhabit. The master bedroom is a heavenly collection of pleasant, artful surfaces from the watery silver wallpaper to gently textured drapery that spared no expense and make this a tranquil escape. A freestanding tub under a barrel vault ceiling and an exquisite chandelier is at the heart of the master bath. A coffee bar and small refrigerator are just outside a workout room and the master closet is complete with full length mirrors, built-in ironing board and plenty of shelving and custom cabinetry.\\r\\n            A game room, a media room with wet bar and icemaker, a large utility room, a three car garage...these are things to expect in a home of this quality, but all are rendered beautiful as well as functional in a home that delivers exceptional features with the highest taste level.\",\n",
